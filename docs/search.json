    "text": "1.1 Introduction and Background\nThis report was created in response to the mayor’s concern about bridge safety in Omaha, NE after several bridge collapses on the East Coast in 2024. Data from the Nebraska Department of Transportation (“ARTBA Bridge Report” n.d.) and the National Bridge Inventory (“Bridge - NDOT” n.d.) was used to look at the current condition of bridges not only in Omaha, but across the state of Nebraska. Bridges were rated as being in poor, fair, or good condition. The report also take into consideration if the bridge was a high traffic.\nAlthough it is hard to predict exactly if or when a bridge may collapse, this data shows that some bridges in the area could be a potential risk to the public if not repaired. The bridges that were inspected to be in poor condition and that carry the most traffic on a daily basis raise the most concern to our city.\nTo reduce the chances of a collapse occurring, Omaha should invest in repairs to bridges that are used more frequently. Being proactive about these issues will keep people safe and prevent a major bridge collapse in the future.Executive Summary\nThe report is organized into the following sections:\nIn this section, the importance of bridge safety is outlined, focusing on the recent bridge collapses on the East Coast that raised concerns in Omaha. The introduction explains the context of the mayor’s request for an analysis of Omaha’s bridges and the need to be proactive about our safety.",

    "text": "After The Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed in Baltimore in 2024 (Franklin 2024), Omaha’s mayor asked for a review of our city’s infrastructure. The report focuses on the chances of a bridge collapse here and the damage it would cause. Bridge safety is a growing concern across our nation, particularly after the tragic collapses on the East Coast. In the U.S. bridges are crucial to transportation and public safety.\nTo understand the risk we face in Omaha, data from Nebraska’s Department of Transportation and the National Bridge Inventory was used to get an overview of Nebraska’s bridge conditions. The data includes how many bridges are in poor condition, how much traffic they carry, and other factors that go into whether a bridge may need repairs or not. Using this data, specific problems like how many high traffic bridges are in poor condition in certain areas are highlighted.\nInitial analysis suggests that certain bridges may be at a high risk of collapse due to the condition of the bridges in that area. This report will explore the potential impact of these conditions, and highlight areas that are cause for concern. The goal of this report is to figure out how likely a bridge collapse is - and what we can do to keep this from happening. This information is beneficial to help city officials make informed decisions and keep our bridges safe.\n\n\n\n\nFranklin, Jonathan. 2024. “The Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore Collapses, 6 Feared Dead.” NPR, March. https://www.npr.org/2024/03/26/1240857704/francis-scott-key-bridge-collapse-baltimore.",

The data was then sorted by different bridge systems in Nebraska, like the County System and the State System. This was important to understanding how bridges across the entire state were doing.\nTraffic Data: The data set included information for specific bridges. Specifically it included the number of vehicles crossing each bridge daily. This gave insight to which bridges might be under more stress on a daily basis.\nRisk Level Calculation: To figure out which bridges pose the highest risk, a risk level was assigned to each bridge.\n\nHigh Risk: Bridges with daily crossings above the 3rd Quartile (32,795). These are bridges with the highest traffic volumes and are likely to be under greater stress.\nModerate Risk: Bridges with daily crossings between the Median (24,360) and 3rd Quartile (32,795). These bridges experience relatively high traffic.\nLow Risk: Bridges with daily crossings below the Median (24,360). These bridges experience lower traffic volumes and face less strain in terms of traffic.",

The State System generally maintains the best conditions, which could be attributed to better funding. On the other hand, counties like Douglas and Sarpy, which have higher numbers of poor or fair-conditioned bridges require attention to ensure safety on.\nThe data also reveals a concerning trend: bridges in poorer condition are likely to carry higher traffic volumes, which means placing more stress on vulnerable structures. This highlights a serious risk for disruptions in transportation if a collapse were to occur.\nIn addition to age and traffic, maintenance history should be further considered in future assessments. While an ANOVA found no direct correlation between the year of construction and bridge condition, regular repairs play an important role in the safety of a bridge.",

    "text": "5.1 Recommendations\nThis report offers a good starting point for understanding the risks of bridge failure in Omaha. However, it is important to keep in mind that the data comes from public sources. While this data is reliable, the inspection methods and how often they inspect the bridges can vary. The data also looks at bridges in all of Nebraska, so it isn’t always specific at the city level. It is also important to keep in mind a bridge collapse can’t exactly be predicted, and this report only considers the likelihood based on their conditions. It gives us a good starting point on what poses us the most risk.\nThe analysis reveals that bridges classified as being in “poor” condition are a significant risk to the city, especially those that carry high traffic volumes. Bridges like US75 over J St, which carry more than 85,000 daily crossings, are an example of a high-risk structure that requires attention. The data indicated that the County System, particularly in areas like Douglas and Sarpy Counties, face the most threat, with higher percentage of poor-condition bridges and high traffic.\nWith that being said, it is clear that focusing on bridges in poor condition, especially those with heavy daily traffic, is critical for reducing risk to our city. These bridges should be prioritized for repairs and improvements. Additionally, while the year a bridge was built does not appear to significantly affect its current condition, ongoing maintenance is crucial for preventing problems in the future.\nIn conclusion, it is essential to be proactive with this information for the safety of Omaha. Using this data Omaha can reduce the likelihood of bridge failures and ensure continued safety.",

That report focuses on the chances of a bridge colapse here and the damage it would cause.\nI used data from Nebraska’s Department of Transportation and the National Bridge Inventory to get an overview of Nebraska’s bridge conditions. The data includes how many bridges are in poor condition, how much traffic they carry, and other factors that go into whether a bridge may need repairs or not. Using this data, I can highlight specific problems like how many high traffic bridges are in poor condition in certain areas. The goal of this report is to figure out how likely a bridge collapse is - and what we can do to keep this from happening. This information is beneficial to help city officials make informed decisions and keep our bridges safe.",

    "text": "C.2 Conclusion\nThis report offers a good starting point for understanding the risks of bridge failure in Omaha. However, it is important to keep in mind that the data comes from public sources. While this data is reliable, the inspection methods and how often they inspect the bridges can vary. The data also looks at bridges in all of Nebraska, so it isn’t always specific at the city level. It is also important to keep in mind a bridge collapse can’t exactly be predicted, and this report only considers the likelihood based on their conditions. It gives us a good starting point on what poses us the most risk.\nThe analysis reveals that bridges classified as being in “poor” condition are a significant risk to the city, especially those that carry high traffic volumes. Bridges like US75 over J St, which carry more than 85,000 daily crossings, are an example of a high-risk structure that requires attention. The data indicated that the County System, particularly in areas like Douglas and Sarpy Counties, face the most threat, with higher percentage of poor-condition bridges and high traffic.\nWith that being said, it is clear that focusing on bridges in poor condition, especially those with heavy daily traffic, is critical for reducing risk to our city. These bridges should be prioritized for repairs and improvements. Additionally, while the year a bridge was built does not appear to significantly affect its current condition, ongoing maintenance is crucial for preventing problems in the future.\nIn conclusion, it is essential to be proactive with this information for the safety of Omaha. Using this data Omaha can reduce the likelihood of bridge failures and ensure continued safety.",

Using data from the Nebraska Department of Transportation and the National Bridge Inventory, I looked at the current condition of bridges not only in Omaha, but across the state of Nebraska. Bridges were rated as being in poor, fair, or good condition. It was also taken into consideration if they were a high traffic bridge or not.\nAlthough it is hard to predict exactly if or when a bridge may collapse, this data shows that some bridges in the area could be a potential risk to the public if not repaired. The bridges that were inspected to be in poor condition and that carry the most traffic on a daily basis raise the most concern to our city.\nTo reduce the chances of a collapse occurring, Omaha should invest in repairs to bridges that are used more frequently. Being proactive about these issues will keep people safe and prevent a major bridge collapse in the future.Executive Summary\nThe report is organized into the following section:",

The introduction explains the context of the mayor’s request for an analysis of Omaha’s bridges and the need to be proactive about our safety.\n\n\nD.1.2 Methods\nThe methods section explains the data sources used in the analysis, including the Nebraska Department of Transportation and the National Bridge Inventory. A description of the bridge rating system - poor, fair, and good - is provided. The methods section includes the consideration of traffic volume, focusing particularly on high traffic bridges as a key factor in determining which bridges are the most at risk. It also outlines the criteria for identifying the bridges that need the most attention.,\n\n\nD.1.3 Results\nThis section presents the findings of my analysis, which breaks down the number of bridges in each condition category (poor, fair, good). It identifies the birdges in poor conditions also carry high daily traffic volumes. From the results, we see that while most bridges are in fair or good condition, there are many in poor condition that have high traffic volumes. This could pose a serious risk to public safety. The results section also provides visuals, such as graphs, to get a better picture of the bridge condtions.\n\n\nD.1.4 Conclusion\nThe conclusion summarizes the key findings in the analysis, highlighting the bridges in poor condition that carry the most traffic. Emphasizing that while the risk of collapse is hard to predict, the data shows that some bridges are at a higher risk due to their condition. The conclusion addresses the need for immediate action to prevent issues in the future.",
